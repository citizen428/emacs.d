My ~/.emacs.d
---

This is my current `~/.emacs.d` and will quite likely always be a WIP.

What's inside?
---

This setup started from [live-coding-emacs](https://github.com/overtone/live-coding-emacs), a
very nice Emacs configuration mainly focussed on Clojure. It's been through a lot of changes since then, and I continuously update it with new findings and configuration snippets I get from blog posts, mailing lists and the Emacs wiki.

License

All the parts I took from elsewhere remain under the license chosen by
the original author. Everything else is licensed under the GPL, mostly because I'm lazy and that's what Emacs' `auto-insert` puts there...
