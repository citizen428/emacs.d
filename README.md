My ~/.emacs.d
---

This is my current `~/.emacs.d` and will quite likely always be a WIP.

What's inside?
---

 - I started from
[live-coding-emacs](https://github.com/overtone/live-coding-emacs), a
very nice Emacs configuration mainly focussed on Clojure.

 - I then installed some parts of the
[emacs-starter-kit](https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit)
through ELPA.

 - Last but not least I added the various configuration snippets I
   got from blog posts, mailing lists and the Emacs wiki.

Todo
---

 -  Cleanup. There are quite likely some conflicts between
    live-coding-emacs, the emacs-starter-kit and my own config which
    I'll eventually have to resolve.
